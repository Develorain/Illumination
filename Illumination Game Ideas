THINGS TO REMEMBER
------------------
Design a map that is hard to traverse.
Do not set velocities, apply a force. (most of the time)
Player can't touch ANYTHING that is dangerous, very hard to traverse in the sense that there is a lot of things to dodge
Check video file on desktop for idea for developing map with slowmo gameplay
Check video file on desktop for idea that using slow motion when wall jumping allows you to get more walljumps in the same amount of time, making slowmotion a very good way to build up y-velocity
Also with the rule above, using slowmotion allows you to double jump much higher


Level 1
-------
Add dropping tiles above first pit. The player is forced to drop into that hole. the box will look hollow:

------------- <-- dropping tiles
-           -
-           -
-------------


Current game problems
---------------------
Make cooldowns work properly with slowmotion // useless
Dispose of maps when done with them, lots of wasted memory
Holding left and right at the same time makes you travel with no friction.
Make jump rely more on how long you hold the jump button, and less initial velocity. // useless
if you jump a split second after you fall off a cliff, the side sensors will trigger walljump instead of a normal jump
consider getting rid of playerSprite



Primary ideas
-------------
Add unwalljumpable walls: introduce it in the tutorial
Add a background
Deadly obstacles
Moving platforms
Player breaks/goes ground if high y-velocity is reached
Add breakable walls or boxes
You can alternate between foreground and background (similiar to Floating Point)
Changing mode fades out some tiles (opacity) and fades in others such as Fly'N mechanic (background becomes foreground and vice versa)
When you go in slow motion, the tileset flips, and maybe make enemies and obstacles depending on the tileset to be visible or not
Teleporter
Respawn slope // useless
Light gets bigger the faster you go
Player light only collides with enemies that player can die from
.setColour() for something that looks cool. Moving changes player colour. This may also change ambient light colour too.
Player dies when changes time in out of bounds area
Lights activate as you go on. Only when you fall into the pit does the light above the pit turn on. Similar to portal levels. Using goomba waiting idea.
Make bodybuilder class // useless
Make MenuScreen
Make death more meaningful



Secondary ideas
---------------
Slow down time in areas of the map
Enemies that's movement pattern resembles the hamster wheels found in Mighty Quest for Epic Loot (enemy movement pattern matches music maybe)
Mimick Dustforce's running up wall // useless
Make it so that holding down jump button makes you jump higher // useless
Doing combos can do a strong dash in a direction that breaks destructable walls
Make dustforce climbing up walls similiar to the wall seen in video 4. pressing up on these walls makes you run up them
Exploder's projectiles kills other enemies. 
Exploder's projecticles spawn small enemies upon landing. 
Exploder's projectiles contaminate ground so player can't walk on it.



Main Mechanics
--------------
	1) Three different collision layers, one is constant, other two are interchangable depending on if the game is in normal time or slow motion
	   This also allows for certain monsters to be visible and collide with you depending on the layer you're on. The two modes are normal speed
	   and slow motion. Slow motion is used to make otherwise impossible passages possible, at the cost of the time running out. Based on the current
	   speed mode, the unused tile set is very translucent with low opacity, and tiles that have collision are not see through.



Cool ideas
----------
Implement a very quick running enemies, enemies that can stick onto walls, rainbow, when enemy is near player, enemy explodes throwing projectiles towards player to kill him, ranged throwing enemy
Some enemies don't kill you, they just push you
Inverted gravity on some levels
Some maps you have 1 restitiuation and you have to get through the map while bouncing
Add a fun mode-type map where jumping instantly teleports you vertically up and swaps gravity, and then jumping again vertically teleports you down and changes gravity back to normal
Can only use teleport to go through specific walls
Some maps have tile opacity of 0, and you need to traverse in complete darkness
Some maps have the player rotate (use old code)
In the main menu, you can control the player before selecting "Start" "Options" etc, and maybe use the player to select these options
Introduce controls by a small rhyming poem
Add screen shake



Graphics
--------
Swinging box2d lights
Player leaves trail just like shadow of texture (MS)
Particle effects when double jumping, jumping, dashing, or moving
Shake screen when hitting ground hard
Add sound effects (jump, landing, walking/sprinting, dash, smashing objects, death)
Add sliding animation
When player dies, they explode into flames
The faster you walk, a bit of black fade in the corners of the screen, add dash like gunz, or popkart nitro white lines in front of player (kinda like a white arc seen on image on desktop)
Brawlhalla has cool artstyle
More see through objects for cool light effects (bookmarks for reference)
Limit the number of rotations that the player can do so it doesn't look like it's not rotating
Add knockback when hit
Ground that has already been traversed is erased
Low gravity areas of the world
Everytime the player jumps, an animation similar to this plays: https://youtu.be/2SaYkWNv0Hg?t=14m37s
Trampoline or propeller similar to Geometry Dash upwards push things
Vignette pulses to the beat of the music
Map is engulfed in flames, you must walk over the flame to quench it



Sound
-----
Make killing enemies sound
Music plays slower when you're in slow motion
Music only plays when you're moving (or plays really slowly when not moving)
Music speeds up as you go faster
Music is intense in hard area, music is calm in easy area
Music is intense when you're moving quickly, calm when you're moving slowly
Sync map/gameplay with music somehow
When changing between slowmotion and non-slowmotion, the slow-mo sound plays
All sounds are slower in slow-motion



Story
-----
Maybe character is a transparent ghost, that's why he can go in multiple dimensions
Explain why the player can be in two dimensions
Square is on a journey to enlighten all the dull squares, making them smart
"Deception was key, the map was determined in stopping cubey. things that looked like they were there were not, and things that appeared to be there weren't there."



Tertiary ideas (meh ideas)
--------------------------
Holding "Z" allows you to slow down time or stop in mid air, allowing you to dash in any direction you choose (by pressing an arrow key)
Walking through an emancipation-grid-esque changes your colour forcefully
Dying alows you to rewind (similar to dirt 3 mechanic)
Player light shows invisible and fake tiles
The light can act as a toggle
Fez-like swapping collision
You can change your light's colour in game using a (league of legends ping based copy) colour picking system. the colour somehow affects collision
Make the y axis limit higher when sprinting (only somewhat good idea)
Pressing down when holding on a wall and no ground is below you allows you to grapple/hold onto the wall
When your head hits a block, you can double jump again
Mario-killing style
Changing modes changes the tile collision
Must be bright in light areas or dark in dark areas
Dark mode: square is black, background is white
Light mode: square is white, background is black
Square always emits a light, mild dark light when in dark mode, mild white light when in light mode
Make screen flip interpolate rotations
NOT ONLY ARE THE TILES THAT ARE NOT USED FOR COLLISION 10% OPACITY, BUT THEY ARE PART OF THE BACKGROUND AS WELL


Friction and movement is stronger in slowmotion. (The problem is that the input/gameplay mechanics still run at 60Hz)
Can not vary timestep for 60 fps, run the 240 timestep 4 times per iteration
Transparent tiles


// How to do the trail
Make a queue that stores body position every 200 ms
Queue only has 5
Draw all 5
