THINGS TO REMEMBER
------------------
Check video file on desktop for idea for developing map with slowmo gameplay
The only way to make the game fun is to make moving and jumping feel fun, sound fun!


Level 1
-------
Add dropping tiles above first pit. The player is forced to drop into that hole. the box will look hollow:

------------- <-- dropping tiles
-           -
-           -
-------------

Things to consider changing about the game
------------------------------------------
Remove double jump
Fix jumping arc to better tighten jumping control
Slowmotion doesn't slow down the player, only the environment
Trail only appears when player is sprinting


Current game problems
---------------------
Dispose of maps when done with them, lots of wasted memory
Holding left and right at the same time makes you travel with no friction.
If you jump a split second after you fall off a cliff, the side sensors will trigger walljump instead of a normal jump
Consider getting rid of playerSprite
Dispose more



Camera focusing
---------------
Every level has a vector2 arraylist of squares "triggers" that will be rendered from the map file
When close to these "triggers", camera interpolates



Ideas
-----
Make music volume depend on player velocity
Change music speed depending on player velocity
Normalize music volume
Make doors big to make player finishing level feel better
Make door sound effect really nice to make finishing level feel great
Reward players as they accomplish things in the level
Consider leaving souls on the ground (similar to coins in mario) so you can leave breadcrumbs in the map
Make projectiles big and fun
Cooler hud text
Levels do not need to do a complete learning curve. Design simple levels into harder levels later.
Maybe add a "DEADLY LINE", if the player touches it they die
Do music slowmo like in super mario world, by not slowing it down, but making each note take longer: reference: https://youtu.be/Aj-Mf0ZVoGs?t=7m18s
Lamps change colour over time
Time doesn't start until you move
Shadow effect after player only activates when player hits max speed (consider something with sprinting)
Reset y velocity to 0 after letting go of jump button to make jumping more responsive



Primary ideas
-------------
Add unwalljumpable walls: introduce it in the tutorial
Add a background
Add breakable walls or boxes
Teleporter
Light gets bigger the faster you go
Player light only collides with enemies that player can die from
.setColour() for something that looks cool. Moving changes player colour. This may also change ambient light colour too.
Player dies when changes time in out of bounds area
Lights activate as you go on. Only when you fall into the pit does the light above the pit turn on. Similar to portal levels. Using goomba waiting idea.
Make MenuScreen
Make death more meaningful



Secondary ideas
---------------
Slow down time in areas of the map
Enemies that's movement pattern resembles the hamster wheels found in Mighty Quest for Epic Loot (enemy movement pattern matches music maybe)
Doing combos can do a strong dash in a direction that breaks destructable walls
Exploder's projectiles kills other enemies.
Exploder's projecticles spawn small enemies upon landing.
Exploder's projectiles contaminate ground so player can't walk on it.
Holding "Z" allows you to slow down time or stop in mid air, allowing you to dash in any direction you choose (by pressing an arrow key)



Main Mechanics
--------------
Three different collision layers, one is constant, other two are interchangable depending on if the game is in normal time or slow motion
This also allows for certain monsters to be visible and collide with you depending on the layer you're on. The two modes are normal speed
and slow motion. Slow motion is used to make otherwise impossible passages possible, at the cost of the time running out. Based on the current
speed mode, the unused tile set is very translucent with low opacity, and tiles that have collision are not see through.



Cool ideas
----------
Implement a very quick running enemies, enemies that can stick onto walls, rainbow, when enemy is near player, enemy explodes throwing projectiles towards player to kill him, ranged throwing enemy
Inverted gravity on some levels
Some maps you have 1 restitiuation and you have to get through the map while bouncing
Add a fun mode-type map where jumping instantly teleports you vertically up and swaps gravity, and then jumping again vertically teleports you down and changes gravity back to normal
In the main menu, you can control the player before selecting "Start" "Options" etc, and maybe use the player to select these options
Introduce controls by a small rhyming poem
Add screen shake



Graphics
--------
Swinging box2d lights
Player leaves trail just like shadow of texture (MS)
Particle effects, sound effect, animation, when double jumping, jumping, dashing, walking, sprinting, smashing objects, death, sliding
Shake screen when hitting ground hard
When player dies, they explode into flames
The faster you walk, a bit of black fade in the corners of the screen (vignette), add dash like gunz, or popkart nitro white lines in front of player
Brawlhalla has cool map artstyle
More see through objects for cool light effects (bookmarks for reference)
Low gravity areas of the world
Everytime the player jumps, an animation similar to this plays: https://youtu.be/2SaYkWNv0Hg?t=14m37s
Trampoline or propeller similar to Geometry Dash upwards push things
Vignette pulses to the beat of the music



Sound
-----
Make killing enemies sound
Music plays slower when you're in slow motion
Music only plays when you're moving (or plays really slowly when not moving)
Music speeds up as you go faster
Music is intense in hard area, music is calm in easy area
Music is intense when you're moving quickly, calm when you're moving slowly
Sync map/gameplay with music somehow
When changing between slowmotion and non-slowmotion, the slow-mo sound plays
All sounds are slower in slow-motion



Game environment/story
-----------------------
Cubey is the soul of a lost traveller,
Maybe character is a transparent ghost, that's why he can go in multiple dimensions
Explain why the player can be in two dimensions
Square is on a journey to enlighten all the dull squares, making them smart
"Deception was key, the map was determined in stopping cubey. things that looked like they were there were not, and things that appeared to be there weren't there."



Ideas up for removal
--------------------
Design a map that is hard to traverse. // useless
Do not set velocities, apply a force. (most of the time) // useless
Player can't touch ANYTHING that is dangerous, very hard to traverse in the sense that there is a lot of things to dodge // useless
Check video file on desktop for idea that using slow motion when wall jumping allows you to get more walljumps in the same amount of time, making slowmotion a very good way to build up y-velocity // useless
Also with the rule above, using slowmotion allows you to double jump much higher // useless
Make cooldowns work properly with slowmotion // useless
Make jump rely more on how long you hold the jump button, and less initial velocity. // useless
Deadly obstacles // useless
Moving platforms // useless
Player breaks/goes ground if high y-velocity is reached // useless
You can alternate between foreground and background (similiar to Floating Point) // useless
Changing mode fades out some tiles (opacity) and fades in others such as Fly'N mechanic (background becomes foreground and vice versa) // useless
When you go in slow motion, the tileset flips, and maybe make enemies and obstacles depending on the tileset to be visible or not // useless
Respawn slope // useless
Make bodybuilder class // useless
Mimick Dustforce's running up wall // useless
Make it so that holding down jump button makes you jump higher // useless
Make dustforce climbing up walls similiar to the wall seen in video 4. pressing up on these walls makes you run up them // useless
Some enemies don't kill you, they just push you // useless
Can only use teleport to go through specific walls // useless
Some maps have tile opacity of 0, and you need to traverse in complete darkness // useless
Some maps have the player rotate (use old code) // useless
Add sound effects (jump, landing, walking/sprinting, dash, smashing objects, death) // useless
Add sliding animation // useless
Limit the number of rotations that the player can do so it doesn't look like it's not rotating // useless
Add knockback when hit // useless
Ground that has already been traversed is erased // useless
Map is engulfed in flames, you must walk over the flame to quench it // useless
Walking through an emancipation-grid-esque changes your colour forcefully // useless
Dying alows you to rewind (similar to dirt 3 mechanic) // useless
Player light shows invisible and fake tiles // useless
The light can act as a toggle // useless
Fez-like swapping collision // useless
You can change your light's colour in game using a (league of legends ping based copy) colour picking system. the colour somehow affects collision // useless
Make the y axis limit higher when sprinting (only somewhat good idea) // useless
Pressing down when holding on a wall and no ground is below you allows you to grapple/hold onto the wall // useless
When your head hits a block, you can double jump again // useless
Mario-killing style // useless
Changing modes changes the tile collision // useless
Must be bright in light areas or dark in dark areas // useless
Dark mode: square is black, background is white // useless
Light mode: square is white, background is black // useless
Square always emits a light, mild dark light when in dark mode, mild white light when in light mode // useless
Make screen flip interpolate rotations // useless
NOT ONLY ARE THE TILES THAT ARE NOT USED FOR COLLISION 10% OPACITY, BUT THEY ARE PART OF THE BACKGROUND AS WELL // useless
Friction and movement is stronger in slowmotion. (The problem is that the input/gameplay mechanics still run at 60Hz) // useless
Can not vary timestep for 60 fps, run the 240 timestep 4 times per iteration // useless
Transparent tiles // useless






// How to do the trail
Make a queue that stores body position every 200 ms
Queue only has 5
