Things that are going to be implemented soon
--------------------------------------------
Fix player trail, sprinting movement limit, jump length, jump height, respawning player/lights - 30 minutes
Reset y velocity to 0 after letting go of jump button to make jumping more responsive - 10 minutes
Remove ugly leaf - 10 minutes



Things to consider changing about the game
------------------------------------------
Remove double jump
Fix jumping arc to better tighten jumping control
Slowmotion doesn't slow down the player, only the environment
Trail only appears when player is sprinting. Shadow effect after player only activates when player hits max speed (or only when sprinting sprinting)



Primary ideas
-------------
There is a zoom function in orthogonal camera
Unwalljumpable walls
Breakable walls or boxes
Teleporter
Player dies when changes time in out of bounds area
Lights activate as you go on. Only when you fall into the pit does the light above the pit turn on. Similar to portal levels. Using goomba waiting idea.
Falling tiles
Consider leaving souls on the ground (similar to coins in mario) so you can leave breadcrumbs in the map
Time doesn't start until you move
Doing combos can do a strong dash in a direction that breaks destructable walls
Holding "Z" allows you to slow down time or stop in mid air, allowing you to dash in any direction you choose (by pressing an arrow key). New game mechanic
Add player states



Enemies
-------
Quick running enemies
Enemies that can stick onto walls
When enemy is near player, enemy explodes throwing projectiles towards player to kill him
Projectile enemy
Enemies that's movement pattern resembles the hamster wheels found in Mighty Quest for Epic Loot (enemy movement pattern matches music maybe)
Exploder's projectiles kills other enemies.
Exploder's projecticles spawn small enemies upon landing.
Exploder's projectiles contaminate ground so player can't walk on it.



Graphics
--------
Background
Swinging box2d lights
Particle effects, sound effect, animation, when double jumping, jumping, dashing, walking, sprinting, smashing objects, death, sliding
When player dies, they explode into flames
The faster you walk, a bit of black fade in the corners of the screen (vignette), add dash like gunz, or popkart nitro white lines in front of player
More see through objects for cool light effects (bookmarks for reference)
Everytime the player jumps, an animation similar to this plays: https://youtu.be/2SaYkWNv0Hg?t=14m37s
Trampoline or propeller similar to Geometry Dash upwards push things
Vignette pulses to the beat of the music
Lamps change colour over time
Make doors big to make player finishing level feel better
Make projectiles big and fun
Cooler hud text
Light gets bigger the faster you go
Player light only collides with enemies that player can die from
.setColour() for something that looks cool. Moving changes player colour. This may also change ambient light colour too.
Add screen shake



Sound
-----
Make killing enemies sound
Music plays slower when you're in slow motion
Music only plays when you're moving (or plays really slowly when not moving)
Music speeds up as you go faster
Music is intense in hard area, music is calm in easy area
Music is intense when you're moving quickly, calm when you're moving slowly
Sync map/gameplay with music somehow
When changing between slowmotion and non-slowmotion, the slow-mo sound plays
All sounds are slower in slow-motion
Make music volume depend on player velocity
Change music speed depending on player velocity
Normalize music volume
Make door sound effect really nice to make finishing level feel great
Do music slowmo like in super mario world, by not slowing it down, but making each note take longer: reference: https://youtu.be/Aj-Mf0ZVoGs?t=7m18s



Cool ideas
----------
Inverted gravity on some levels
Some maps you have 1 restitiuation and you have to get through the map while bouncing
Game mode where jumping instantly teleports you vertically up and swaps gravity, and then jumping again vertically teleports you down and changes gravity back to normal
In the main menu, you can control the player before selecting "Start" "Options" etc, and maybe use the player to select these options
Introduce controls by a small rhyming poem


Current game problems
---------------------
Replace box2d lights with better alternative
Increasing resolution shows you more of the map
Higher dpi screens makes the game look tiny
Add dpi scaling (at same size increasing resolution should keep the game the same size: at same resolution, increasing screen size should make the game bigger)
Standing on a slope slowly makes you slide down



Game environment/story
-----------------------
Cubey is the soul of a lost traveller,
Maybe character is a transparent ghost, that's why he can go in multiple dimensions
Explain why the player can be in two dimensions
Square is on a journey to enlighten all the dull squares, making them smart
"Deception was key, the map was determined in stopping cubey. things that looked like they were there were not, and things that appeared to be there weren't there."



Game Mechanics
--------------
Three different collision layers, one is constant, other two are interchangable depending on if the game is in normal time or slow motion
This also allows for certain monsters to be visible and collide with you depending on the layer you're on. The two modes are normal speed
and slow motion. Slow motion is used to make otherwise impossible passages possible, at the cost of the time running out. Based on the c-
urrent speed mode, the unused tile set is very translucent with low opacity, and tiles that have collision are not see through.



Ideas up for removal
--------------------
Design a map that is hard to traverse. // useless
Do not set velocities, apply a force. (most of the time) // useless
Player can't touch ANYTHING that is dangerous, very hard to traverse in the sense that there is a lot of things to dodge // useless
Slow motion when wall jumping allows you to get more walljumps in the same amount of time, making slowmotion a very good way to build up y-velocity // useless
Also with the rule above, using slowmotion allows you to double jump much higher // useless
Make cooldowns work properly with slowmotion // useless
Make jump rely more on how long you hold the jump button, and less initial velocity. // useless
Deadly obstacles // useless
Moving platforms // useless
Player breaks/goes ground if high y-velocity is reached // useless
You can alternate between foreground and background (similiar to Floating Point) // useless
Changing mode fades out some tiles (opacity) and fades in others such as Fly'N mechanic (background becomes foreground and vice versa) // useless
When you go in slow motion, the tileset flips, and maybe make enemies and obstacles depending on the tileset to be visible or not // useless
Respawn slope // useless
Make bodybuilder class // useless
Mimick Dustforce's running up wall // useless
Make it so that holding down jump button makes you jump higher // useless
Make dustforce climbing up walls similiar to the wall seen in video 4. pressing up on these walls makes you run up them // useless
Some enemies don't kill you, they just push you // useless
Can only use teleport to go through specific walls // useless
Some maps have tile opacity of 0, and you need to traverse in complete darkness // useless
Some maps have the player rotate (use old code) // useless
Add sound effects (jump, landing, walking/sprinting, dash, smashing objects, death) // useless
Add sliding animation // useless
Limit the number of rotations that the player can do so it doesn't look like it's not rotating // useless
Add knockback when hit // useless
Ground that has already been traversed is erased // useless
Map is engulfed in flames, you must walk over the flame to quench it // useless
Walking through an emancipation-grid-esque changes your colour forcefully // useless
Dying alows you to rewind (similar to dirt 3 mechanic) // useless
Player light shows invisible and fake tiles // useless
The light can act as a toggle // useless
Fez-like swapping collision // useless
You can change your light's colour in game using a (league of legends ping based copy) colour picking system. the colour somehow affects collision // useless
Make the y axis limit higher when sprinting (only somewhat good idea) // useless
Pressing down when holding on a wall and no ground is below you allows you to grapple/hold onto the wall // useless
When your head hits a block, you can double jump again // useless
Mario-killing style // useless
Changing modes changes the tile collision // useless
Must be bright in light areas or dark in dark areas // useless
Dark mode: square is black, background is white // useless
Light mode: square is white, background is black // useless
Square always emits a light, mild dark light when in dark mode, mild white light when in light mode // useless
Make screen flip interpolate rotations // useless
NOT ONLY ARE THE TILES THAT ARE NOT USED FOR COLLISION 10% OPACITY, BUT THEY ARE PART OF THE BACKGROUND AS WELL // useless
Friction and movement is stronger in slowmotion. (The problem is that the input/gameplay mechanics still run at 60Hz) // useless
Can not vary timestep for 60 fps, run the 240 timestep 4 times per iteration // useless
Transparent tiles // useless
Slow down time in areas of the map // useless
Reward players as they accomplish things in the level // useless
Make death more meaningful // useless
Shake screen when hitting ground hard // useless
Low gravity areas of the world // useless
