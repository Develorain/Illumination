Graphics
--------
Background
Swinging box2d lights
Particle effects, sound effect, animation, when double jumping, jumping, dashing, walking, sprinting, smashing objects, death, sliding
When player dies, they explode into flames
The faster you walk, a bit of black fade in the corners of the screen (vignette), add dash like gunz, or popkart nitro white lines in front of player
More see through objects for cool light effects (bookmarks for reference)
Everytime the player jumps, an animation similar to this plays: https://youtu.be/2SaYkWNv0Hg?t=14m37s
Trampoline or propeller similar to Geometry Dash upwards push things
Vignette pulses to the beat of the music
Lamps change colour over time
Make doors big to make player finishing level feel better
Make projectiles big and fun
Cooler hud text
Light gets bigger the faster you go
Player light only collides with enemies that player can die from
.setColour() for something that looks cool. Moving changes player colour. This may also change ambient light colour too.
Add screen shake
Lights activate as you go on. Only when you fall into the pit does the light above the pit turn on. Similar to portal levels. Using goomba waiting idea.
Projectiles have lights within them



Sound
-----
Make killing enemies sound
Music plays slower when you're in slow motion
Music only plays when you're moving (or plays really slowly when not moving)
Music speeds up as you go faster
Music is intense in hard area, music is calm in easy area
Music is intense when you're moving quickly, calm when you're moving slowly
Sync map/gameplay with music somehow
When changing between slowmotion and non-slowmotion, the slow-mo sound plays
All sounds are slower in slow-motion
Make music volume depend on player velocity
Change music speed depending on player velocity
Normalize music volume
Make door sound effect really nice to make finishing level feel great
Do music slowmo like in super mario world, by not slowing it down, but making each note take longer: reference: https://youtu.be/Aj-Mf0ZVoGs?t=7m18s



Cool ideas
----------
Inverted gravity on some levels
Some maps you have 1 restitiuation and you have to get through the map while bouncing
Game mode where jumping instantly teleports you vertically up and swaps gravity, and then jumping again vertically teleports you down and changes gravity back to normal
In the main menu, you can control the player before selecting "Start" "Options" etc, and maybe use the player to select these options
Introduce controls by a small rhyming poem
Leave souls on the ground (similar to coins in mario) so you can leave breadcrumbs in the map



Game environment/story
-----------------------
Cubey is the soul of a lost traveller,
Maybe character is a transparent ghost, that's why he can go in multiple dimensions
Explain why the player can be in two dimensions
Square is on a journey to enlighten all the dull squares, making them smart
"Deception was key, the map was determined in stopping cubey. things that looked like they were there were not, and things that appeared to be there weren't there."
