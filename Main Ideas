Things that are going to be implemented soon
--------------------------------------------
Falling tiles - 20 minutes
Time doesn't start until you move - 10 minutes
Fix player trail, sprinting movement limit, jump length, jump height, respawning player/lights - 30 minutes
Reset y velocity to 0 after letting go of jump button to make jumping more responsive - 10 minutes
Think of a new game mechanic based on below: - 30 minutes
Holding "Z" allows you to slow down time or stop in mid air, allowing you to dash in any direction you choose (by pressing an arrow key). New game mechanic



Things to consider changing about the game
------------------------------------------
Remove double jump
Fix jumping arc to better tighten jumping control
Slowmotion doesn't slow down the player, only the environment
Trail only appears when player is sprinting. Shadow effect after player only activates when player hits max speed (or only when sprinting sprinting)



Primary ideas
-------------
There is a zoom function in orthogonal camera
Teleporter
Unclimbable walls
Player dies when changes time in out of bounds area
Add player states
Add rain effects and background sound and lightning flash and storm sound



Enemies
-------
Fast-running enemies
Enemies that can stick onto walls
When enemy is near player, enemy explodes throwing projectiles towards player to kill him
Projectile enemy
Enemies that's movement pattern resembles the hamster wheels found in Mighty Quest for Epic Loot (enemy movement pattern matches music maybe)
Exploder's projectiles kills other enemies
Exploder's projectiles spawn small enemies upon landing
Exploder's projectiles contaminate ground so player can't walk on it



Current game problems
---------------------
Replace box2d lights with better alternative
Increasing resolution shows you more of the map
Higher dpi screens makes the game look tiny
Add dpi scaling (at same size increasing resolution should keep the game the same size: at same resolution, increasing screen size should make the game bigger)
Standing on a slope slowly makes you slide down
On a slope, player walljumps instead of jumps



Game Mechanics
--------------
Three different collision layers, one is constant, other two are interchangable depending on if the game is in normal time or slow motion
This also allows for certain monsters to be visible and collide with you depending on the layer you're on. The two modes are normal speed
and slow motion. Slow motion is used to make otherwise impossible passages possible, at the cost of the time running out. Based on the c-
urrent speed mode, the unused tile set is very translucent with low opacity, and tiles that have collision are not see through.
